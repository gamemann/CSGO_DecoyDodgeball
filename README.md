An once popular mod and plugin for the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The plugin was made for [SourceMod](https://www.sourcemod.net/)!

This mod continuously equips decoys to players after throwing and sets a player's health to 1 by default on spawn. Additionally, there are many other settings and also support for minigame-like gameplay (e.g. being able to set configuration settings for special rounds).

## Installation
1. Compile `addons/sourcemod/scripting/dodgeball.sp` with SourceMod which will create a `.smx` file.
1. Copy or move the `.smx` file into the `addons/sourcemod/plugins/` directory.
1. Copy or move the `addons/sourcemod/configs/` and `addons/cfg/` directories to the game's main directory (`csgo/`).

## Configuration
When loading the plugin, a configuration file should be created automatically at `csgo/cfg/sourcemod/plugin.dodgeball.cfg`. You may configure the mod there and also adjust the plugins's ConVars in the server's console if you don't want to wait until a map/server reload!
